### Introduction

This is an account of my Grandad, Stan Still, and his life. We have been having a call once a week every Monday at ~7pm for 30-60 minutes. 

From the third week (27th January 2020) I have started recording the calls, although the quality is quite poor. Also I'm not very good at writing down what he says quickly so there are a lot of pauses and time wasted.

I'm going to start storing the recodings on here as well.

We talked about his life after the RAF, his time at the school in Birkhampstead. Then his time working at the Royal Agricultural College in Cirencester, where he lived at first, him and Nana getting married in Seaham, their honey moon in Blackpool, the first cottage they rented in Ciren, then the second place.
